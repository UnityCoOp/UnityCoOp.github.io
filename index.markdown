Unity is a place where home schoolers can come and together and learn with other home schooled children and young people, and discover interesting topics such as beekeeping, maths, building construction and art.

We do this at New Life Church in Parkhead.

Christian families are welcome to bring their children, aged four and upwards, to learn in a Christian family environment.
